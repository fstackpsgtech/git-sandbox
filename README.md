**New to Git and GitHub?**

This repositry will provide a platform and resources on how to master them in a short time.

## Why use Git and GitHub?
>   Git is a version control system (VCS) that makes it easier to track changes to files.
    For example, when you edit a file, git can help you determine exactly what changed, who changed it, and why.

**Feel its too complex to learn?**

Try out this simple youtube playlist.

   - [Git and GitHub for poets](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV) -
    This is one of the easiest and quite interesting tutorial series about Git and GitHub.
    (you may skip the part about GitHub Pages for now if you want).
    

> At first, the concepts of Git feel difficult and intimidating to grasp, that's completely fine.
    Each one of us have been there atleast once, so don't let this de-motivate you.
